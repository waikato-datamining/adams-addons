\chapter{Introduction}
\textit{Jep} embeds CPython in Java through JNI\cite{jep}.

\section{Flow}
The following standalones are available:
\begin{tight_itemize}
	\item \textit{JepEngine} -- provides a local scripting engine for executing
	scripts instead of using the global one; parallel executed scripts must ensure
	that variable names do not interfere with each other
	\item \textit{Jep} -- executes the script (inline or external)
\end{tight_itemize}
The following sources are available:
\begin{tight_itemize}
	\item \textit{Jep} -- executes the script (inline or external) and outputs any specified variables as map.
\end{tight_itemize}

\section{Python environment}
Jep utilizes the Python environment in which ADAMS has been started up. You have two options:
\begin{tight_itemize}
    \item install all necessary Python libraries globally
    \item use a virtual environment\footnote{\url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html}{}}
\end{tight_itemize}

\noindent When using a \textit{virtual environment}, you need to activate this environment before you launch
ADAMS. The \texttt{launcher.sh/.bat} and \texttt{exec.sh/.bat} scripts have a \texttt{-venv PATH}
option that allow you to specify the virtual environment that you want to activate.
If you are starting ADAMS from \texttt{start\_gui.sh/.bat}, then you will need to modify
the script, appending \texttt{-venv PATH} to the launcher call, using the appropriate path.

\clearpage
\section{Tools}
\subsection{Jep/Python console}
The \textit{Jep/Python console} is a simple Python editor with syntax highlighting that allows you
to execute the current script as well (see Figure \ref{jep-console}). With this interface you can
prototype your scripts before they are being inserted into any flows. Please be aware that

Python's output on stdout/stderr gets also redirected to the ADAMS \textit{Console window} (available
from the \textit{Program} menu in the ADAMS main menu). However, output from other Python libraries
may bypass that. It is advised to keep an eye on the output in the terminal from which ADAMS was
launched.
