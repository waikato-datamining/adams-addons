/**

 * Uses a pyramidal KLT tracker to track features inside the user selected region. The motion of the region is found robustly using LeastMedianOfSquares and a translation + rotation model. Drift is a problem since motion is estimated relative to the previous frame and it will eventually drift away from the original target. When it works well it is very smooth and can handle partially obscured objects. Can't recover after the target has been lost. Runs very fast.
